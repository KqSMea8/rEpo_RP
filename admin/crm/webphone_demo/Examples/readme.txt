These folders contains skin examples for the Mizutech webphone. Change/modify after your needs.


The files have to be hosted on a webserver.
You must copy the webphone.jar in the skin directory first, then edit the webphone.htm file (add at least your SIP server address)
Launch the webphone by opening the webphone.htm in your browser, or integrate it with your website (for example just add it in a frame)

You need at least the Standard license for the skins to work (the basic version doesn't contain the java script API)
