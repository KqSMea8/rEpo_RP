How to run a quick test?
------------------------
Open an html example files and not the webphone.jar (the html files will load the .jar file). 
You must host the files on a webserver (will not work when launched from local file system).
You must place the html file and the .jar file in the same directory (this can also modified by the applet parameter but these example html files will not work if the webphone.jar is not found in the same directory.
To make the websipphone usable you must set at least the "serveraddress" applet parameter in the html file. (set to your VoIP server domain name or IP address)
